## Goal
A brief description of your product. What is it? What does it do?

## Quick-start
How to install and launch your application. If there is a dependency (e.g. "requires a network connection to operate") list it here.

## Screenshots/videos
Optional, but often helpful to have a screenshot or demo-video for new users.
